Automating File Organization in AWS S3 using Lambda Functions


Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate file organization in an AWS S3 bucket using Python and Lambda Functions. The Lambda Function triggers whenever a new file is added to the S3 bucket, organizing it into folders based on the file's creation date.

Requirements
AWS Account with access to Lambda, S3, and IAM services.
Python 3.x installed locally.
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions.
Setup Instructions
Create an S3 Bucket:

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to S3 and create a new bucket (my-automated-bucket).
Create an IAM Role:

Go to IAM and create a new role (LambdaS3ExecutionRole) with permissions:
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess: Allows Lambda to read from S3.
(Add any other permissions needed for your specific use case.)
Set up Lambda Function:

Create a new Lambda Function (FileOrganizer) in your AWS Lambda console.
Use Python 3.x as the runtime.
Attach the LambdaS3ExecutionRole IAM role to this function.
Upload Function Code:

Copy the Python code (lambda_function.py) provided in this repository.
Package any necessary dependencies (boto3) with your function code.
Configure Lambda Trigger:

Add an S3 trigger to your Lambda Function (my-automated-bucket).
Set the trigger to activate on object creation events.
Testing:

Upload a file to your S3 bucket to test the Lambda function.
Check the destination folder (YYYYMMDD/filename) to verify file organization.

Project Title: Automating File Organization in AWS S3 with Python and Lambda Functions

Objective:
The goal of this project is to automate the process of organizing files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The solution involves creating an AWS Lambda function that is triggered whenever a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket. The function then moves the file to a folder named with the format YYYYMMDD/filename, based on the file's creation date.

Technologies Used:

AWS S3: For file storage.
AWS Lambda: For executing the automation code.
Python: For writing the Lambda function.
Key Steps:

Setting Up the S3 Bucket:

Created an S3 bucket to store the files.
Configured S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function upon the addition of a new file.
Creating the Lambda Function:

Wrote a Python script for the Lambda function.
The script performs the following tasks:
Retrieves the event data to get details of the newly added file.
Extracts the file's creation date.
Constructs the destination path using the format YYYYMMDD/filename.
Copies the file to the new location within the S3 bucket.
Deletes the original file from the root of the bucket.
Deploying and Testing:

Deployed the Lambda function using the AWS Management Console.
Tested the solution by uploading files to the S3 bucket and verifying they were moved to the appropriate folders.
Challenges and Solutions:

Handling Permissions: Ensured that the Lambda function had the necessary permissions to read from and write to the S3 bucket by attaching an appropriate IAM role.
Efficient File Handling: Used Python's boto3 library for efficient interaction with S3, ensuring the file operations were performed reliably.
Outcome:
The automation significantly reduced manual effort in organizing files, ensuring that they are systematically stored based on their creation date. This not only improved file management but also made it easier to locate files quickly.

Future Improvements:

Implement error handling and logging to better monitor the Lambda function's execution.
Optimize the script for handling large files or a high volume of file uploads.
